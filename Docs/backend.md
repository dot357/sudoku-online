#### New Game
```mermaid

  autonumber
  participant C as Client
  participant A as Nitro API
  participant S as Sudoku Services
  participant DB as Prisma/SQLite

  C->>A: POST /api/game/new { rank }
  A->>A: getOrCreateSid() (HTTP-only cookie)
  A->>S: generateSolution()
  A->>S: makePuzzle(solution, rank)
  A->>DB: game.create({ sid, stateJson })
  DB-->>A: game row
  A-->>C: GamePublicStateDTO (no solution)
```

##### Puzzle uniqueness
Puzzles are generated by progressively removing cells from a solved grid.
Each removal is validated using a bounded backtracking solver to ensure the
resulting puzzle has **exactly one valid solution**.

This guarantees that all user moves are unambiguous and that the server-side
solution remains the single source of truth.

#### Move
```mermaid

  participant C as Client
  participant A as Nitro API

  participant F as tryFinishGame()

  C->>A: POST /api/game/:id/move { index, value }
  A->>A: getOrCreateSid()
  A->>DB: game.findUnique(id)
  A->>A: ownership check (game.sid === sid)
  A->>A: reject if paused / finished / given cell
  A->>A: apply scoring (+5 correct from null, -1 wrong)
  A->>F: tryFinishGame(state)
  A->>DB: game.update(stateJson, status)
  alt finished
    A->>DB: record.create({ gameId, score, durationSec })
  end
  A-->>C: DTO + move result + optional finished bonus
